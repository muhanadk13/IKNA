# IKNA - Smart Flashcard App

I built this because I wanted a better way to study. Traditional flashcard apps were clunky, so I created a modern web app with AI-powered card generation and spaced repetition.

## What I Built
- React frontend with TypeScript and modern animations
- Node.js backend with JWT auth
- SuperMemo 2 spaced repetition algorithm
- AI integration for automatic card generation
- Docker deployment ready

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Backend: Node.js, Express, JWT
- Database: PostgreSQL (planned), Redis caching
- DevOps: Docker, Docker Compose

## Challenges & Learnings
- Implementing spaced repetition algorithms was tricky 
- State management across complex UI flows took iteration
- Learned a lot about TypeScript generics and type safety

## Next Steps
- Add real database integration
- Implement user authentication
- Add comprehensive testing
- Deploy to production
